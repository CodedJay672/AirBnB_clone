**AirBnB Clone Project**


**Project Description**

This project will be the first step in creating an Airbnb. However this AirBnB will not have all the features of the orginal, it will only have few of the implemented features.

**Command Interpreter Description**

* How to start it.

	The command Interpreter can be started by executing the console.py.
	After, executing the .py file the prompt will come up and then commands can be typed.

* How to use it.

	Once the prompt is visible, commands may be entered. 
	Different commands generate different output. 
	For example: "help" typed alone brings up all the commands that are in the baseModel class.
	"help" typed with an existing command within baseModel will bring up a description of the command if it's documented.
